EXPLAIN BEFORE & AFTER HERE GITHUB FOLDER:aziziteration10explainpictures



Used LIMIT to stop the query from scanning addiontal rows since we only care about 3 of them and to prevent duplicate - lowers time
Adding an index:

ALTER TABLE movie_media ADD INDEX idx(m_link_type);

This is the over 100,000 data set:
This is used on 1,175,493 rows and returns the below time
Showing rows 0 - 2 (3 total, Query took 0.8430 seconds.)

SELECT m_link_type, count(*)
FROM movie_media
GROUP BY m_link_type
LIMIt 3


This is the orginal data:

This is used on 18 rows and returns the below time
Showing rows 0 - 2 (3 total, Query took 0.0011 seconds.)

SELECT m_link_type, count(*)
FROM movie_media
GROUP BY m_link_type;

SELECT DISTINCT `id`,`stage_name`,`first_name`,`middle_name`,`last_name`,`gender`,`image_name`,`people_trivia_id`,`people_trivia_name` 
FROM `people`
INNER JOIN `people_trivia` 
ON `id` = `people_id`
WHERE `id` = `people_id`
[2]
id = 1 and 1
select_type = simple and simple
table = people_trivia and people
type = ALL and eq_ref
possible_keys = Null and Primary
key = Null and Primary

Extra = Using temporary
Showing rows 0 - 24 (83630 total, Query took 0.0018 seconds.)

So I removed DISTINCT and the WHERE CLAUSE also added LIMIT 3 for duplicates

Query 10: Get the list of trivia for the songs. 
By Sharmarke Mohamed
SELECT song_trivia.song_trivia_id, song_trivia.song_trivia_name, songs.song_id, songs.title, songs.lyrics, songs.theme 
from song_trivia 
join songs 
on (songs.song_id = song_trivia.song_id)

Explain:
id = 1 and 1
select_type = SIMPLE and SIMPLE
table = song_trivia and songs
partitions = NULL and NULL
type = ALL and eq_ref
possible_keys = NULL and PRIMARY
key = NULL and PRIMARY
key_len = NULL and 4
ref = NULL and omdb.song_trivia.song_id
rows = 256 and 1
filtered = 100 and 100
Extra = NULL and NULL
Showing rows 0 - 24 (256 total, Query took 0.0006 seconds.)

New Query 10:
SELECT song_trivia.song_trivia_id, song_trivia.song_trivia_name, songs.song_id, songs.title, songs.lyrics, songs.theme 
FROM song_trivia 
JOIN songs on (songs.song_id = song_trivia.song_id) 
WHERE song_trivia.song_trivia_id BETWEEN 1 AND 8 
LIMIT 8

CHANGES: I added WHERE and BETWEEN, to further lower the amount of rows(i want the 8 unique rows).
I then changed the syntax, making the FROM, and JOIN capital letters. LIMIT decreased the time by 1.

Explain:
id = 1 and 1
select_type = SIMPLE and SIMPLE
table = song_trivia and songs
partitions = NULL and NULL
type = range and eq_ref
possible_keys = PRIMARY and PRIMARY
key = NULL and PRIMARY
key_len = 4 and 4
ref = NULL and omdb.song_trivia.song_id
rows = 8 and 1
filtered = 100 and 100
Extra = using WHERE and NULL
Showing rows 0 - 7 (8 total, Query took 0.0004 seconds.)
